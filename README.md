# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for my prework

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? I was motivated to understand the coding language and dev tools I'll be using.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") The purpose of this project was to get prepared before the course starts. 
- What problem does it solve? It solves the problems of taking time to setup your PC for coding purposes. 
- What did you learn? I learned a basic knowledge of what code is, how it is created, and how to access/share it.

## Usage

This study guide can be used for reference on what roles HTML, Javascript, and CSS have when building a website. HTML has the role of being the foundation of the website. CSS has the role of adding details to the site. Javascript is where you create the interaction of the site. The files and branches the code was saved in will give examples of how code is supposed to look when saved in your Git branches. There will be sections giving information on how to properly use Devtools. This study guide will help with retention on what needs to be used when creating a website.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
